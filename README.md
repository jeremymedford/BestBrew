1. Location-aware mapview displays coffee shops near user's location when location services are enabled.
2. A search bar provides the ability to search for a location. Enabled whether or not location services are enable or not.
3. Each pin can be tapped to provide name and address for venue.
4. Annotation view can be tapped to display a details page with a list of tips provided by public Foursquare data.

- No third party libraries used, but some code originating from Treehouse Swift Networking course provided a foundation that I built off
of to create the networking stack.
